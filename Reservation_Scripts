Question - The total number of nights reserved, by unitID, in periods of months. 
          Solution Steps
           1. Count length of reservations 
           2. Group by UnitID and Month
           
    SELECT UnitID, MONTH(FirstNight), SUM(DATEDIFF(DAY, FirstNight, LastNight)) AS NightsRented
    FROM reservation 
    GROUP BY UnitID, MONTH(FirstNight)
    ORDER BY UnitID DESC, MONTH(FirstNight) ASC
    
Question 2 - The total number of nights reserved over the total number of nights, by unitID, in periods of months. 
        Solution Steps
        1. Count length of reservation 
        2. Divide by average days in a month 
        3. Group by UnitId and Month
        
   WITH ReservedNights (UnitID, Month, NightsRented) AS
   (SELECT UnitID, MONTH(FirstNight), SUM(DATEDIFF(DAY, FirstNight, LastNight)) AS NightsRented
   FROM reservation 
   GROUP BY UnitID, MONTH(FirstNight))
   SELECT UnitID, Month, NightsRented / (365/12)
   FROM ReservedNights
   ORDER BY UnitID DESC, Month ASC     

Question 3 - The total number of nights reserved, by unitID, in periods of months compared to the same period of the previous year. 
        Solution Steps
        1. Count length of reservation 
        2. Create CTE in order to use window function 
        3. Use window function to capture previous year's data

  WITH ReservedNights (UnitID, Month, NightsRented) AS
  (SELECT UnitID, MONTH(FirstNight), SUM(DATEDIFF(DAY, FirstNight, LastNight)) AS NightsRented
  FROM reservation 
  GROUP BY UnitID, MONTH(FirstNight))
  SELECT UnitID, Month, NightsRented AS NightsRentedCY, LAG(NightsRented, 1) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR) AS NightsRentedPY
  FROM ReservedNights
  ORDER BY UnitID DESC, Month ASC

Question 4 - The total number of nights reserved, by city-state, in periods of months compared to the same period of the previous year. 
      Solution Steps
      1. Join to unit table to caputure city state data 
      2. Count length of reservation 
      3. Create CTE in order to use window function 
      4. Use window function to retrieve previous year's data

  WITH ReservedNightsByCityState (City, State, NightsRented) as
  (SELECT u.City, u.State,  SUM(DATEDIFF(DAY, r.FirstNight, r.LastNight)) as NightsRented
  FROM reservation AS r
  LEFT JOIN unit AS u
    ON r.UnitID=u.UnitID
  GROUP BY  u.state, u.city)
  SELECT City, State, NightsRented as NightsRentedCY, LAG(NightsRented, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Year) as NightsRentedPY
  FROM ReseveredNightsByCityState
  ORDER BY State ASC, City ASC
